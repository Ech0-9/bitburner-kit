# BitBurner Scripts

This is my personal script library for BitBurner (Steam version)

# Ports

| Port Number | Description          |
| ----------- | -----------          |
| 1           | Project Starting     |
| 2           | Task Completion      |
| 3           | Project Completion   |

# Notes

- according to my research, running a solver for contracts does not increase the rewards based on the threads, the rewards are only a function of multiplier stats and difficulty.
- d_scanner and d_tasker combo currently requires 12Gb RAM together.  consider moving analysis to it's own script
